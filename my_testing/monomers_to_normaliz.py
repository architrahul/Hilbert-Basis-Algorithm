# File name: multiset_to_vector.py
#
# This script reads a text file (monomers.txt) where each line represents a multiset of domains (called a monomer),
# converts each monomer into a vector representation, and outputs the results to two files:
# 1. A space-separated text file (vectors.txt) with vector representations and configurable singleton vectors.
# 2. An 'eqs.in' file with the transposed matrix and additional information.
# After processing, it outputs the number of domains and monomers to the command line.
#
# Input: A text file where each line contains space-separated domain names.
#        - Lines may start with text followed by a colon, which is ignored.
#        - Lines may end with a comma followed by text, which is ignored.
#        - Domains followed by a star (e.g., 'dom1*') represent negative counts.
# Output: 
#   - A space-separated text file (vectors.txt) where:
#     - The first line contains the domain names (header)
#     - Subsequent lines contain the vector representation of the input monomers
#     - The final set of lines contains singleton vectors (configurable)
#   - An 'eqs.in' file containing:
#     - The transposed matrix (excluding the header)
#     - Additional information as specified
#   - Command line output with the number of domains and monomers
#
# The script handles cases where some monomers may not contain all domains.
# The order of domains in the output is based on their first appearance in the input file.
# Domains with stars are treated as negative counts in the vector representation.
